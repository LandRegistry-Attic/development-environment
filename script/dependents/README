This directory contains scripts that will be copied into dependent projects by the bootstrap script.

The scripts in this directory will be copied into the 'dev' directory in dependent projects.

If you want to override this behaviour in dependent projects simply create your own 'dev' directory in the projects
and your own scripts will be run instead, although you'll have to replicate all of the functionality of the boostrapper.
